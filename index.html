    <!-- this is paragraph -->
    <p>Kinsey drives me absolutely crazy. Every day in class, he’s sitting there picking his nose like it’s nothing, and then he wipes it somewhere like we won’t notice. It’s honestly disgusting, but what really gets me is how casual he is about it—like this is just part of his daily routine. I don’t even think he realizes how gross it is or how much it bothers everyone around him. I’m not even trying to be mean, but it’s hard to focus when I’m constantly wondering where his latest booger ended up.</p>
